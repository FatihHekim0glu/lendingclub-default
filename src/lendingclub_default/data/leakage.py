"""Post-funding leakage allowlist and the canonical ``drop_leakage`` filter.

Post-funding leakage is THE trap of LendingClub default modelling. The accepted-
loans CSV ships dozens of columns that are only populated *after* a loan is
funded — payments received, recoveries, charge-off bookkeeping, hardship and
settlement records. Every one of these encodes (directly or indirectly) the loan
outcome we are trying to predict, so a model that sees them scores a fraudulent
~0.99 AUC. :data:`LEAKAGE_COLS` is the frozen, reviewed allowlist of every such
column from the LendingClub data dictionary; :func:`drop_leakage` removes any of
them that are present so only origination-time features reach the model.

This module is pure reference data plus one pure function. Importing it has no
side effects.

    but not identical subsets of these fields).

    Returns
